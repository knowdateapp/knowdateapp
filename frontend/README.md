The project was created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Requirements

The application requires a version of `node >= 18`.

## Available Scripts

Before running the scripts, perform package installation by running `yarn`.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn preview`

Locally preview the production build. Do not use this as a production server as it's not designed for it.

### `yarn lint`

Runs eslint to check the code.

### `yarn lint:fix`

Corrects code not compliant with eslint rules.

More information about the commands can be found in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli).
